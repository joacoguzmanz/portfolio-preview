# Portfolio preview

So this is a concept of how I want my portfolio to look. Once the project is really finished I'll be moving it to another hosting and link my own domain. The backend is going to be made in Django.

## Things to add

- Functional contact form
- Blog section
- Case study template (for portfolio projects)
- Some images
